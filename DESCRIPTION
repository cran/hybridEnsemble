Description: Functions to build and deploy a hybrid ensemble consisting of different sub-ensembles such as bagged logistic regressions, random forest, stochastic boosting, kernel factory, bagged neural networks, bagged support vector machines, rotation forest, bagged k-nearest neighbors, and bagged naive Bayes. Functions to cross-validate the hybrid ensemble and plot and summarize the results are also provided. There is also a function to assess the importance of the predictors.
