Description: Functions to build and deploy a hybrid ensemble consisting of eight different sub-ensembles: bagged logistic regressions, random forest, stochastic boosting, kernel factory, bagged neural networks, bagged support vector machines, rotation forest, and bagged k-nearest neighbors. Functions to cross-validate the hybrid ensemble and plot and summarize the results are also provided. There is also a function to assess the importance of the predictors.
