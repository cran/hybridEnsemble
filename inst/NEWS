Planned changes in next versions:
----------------------------------------

-parameter to yield prediction vectors of sub-ensembles and also summary and plots
-add parameter to use percentile ranks instead of calibration
-incorporate statistical test in table
-mechanism to compute and plot variance of predictions for all sub-ensembles and meta ensemble


Change log:
----------------------------------------

* Version 1.0.0: May, 26 2015

-added a seventh base classifier: rotation forest
-add an eight base classifier: bagged nearest neighbors
-added parameters for size of sub-ensembles
-added oversampling to alleviate problems related to class imbalance and subsequent subsetting
-added a filter parameter to remove near constants that often produced problems in subsetting.
-added error handling
-added formal automated tests
-refactored for faster and shorter code
-changed to [-1,1] scaling in neural networks
-made sure that no (near) constants can be produced in bagging procedures
-corrected typesetting issues in documentation

* Version 0.1.1: March 2014
- Fixed small bug that occurred in rare cases

* Version 0.1.0: December 2013
- Package submitted to CRAN with main functions hybridEnsemble, predict, importance, CVhybridEnsemble, plot, summary
